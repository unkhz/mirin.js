        Mirin (味醂 or みりん?) is an essential condiment used in Japanese cuisine, consisting of 40%–50% sugar.[1] It is a kind of rice wine similar to sake, but with a lower alcohol content—14%[2] instead of 20%. There are three general types. The first is hon mirin (lit. true mirin),[3] which contains alcohol. The second is shio mirin, which contains alcohol as well as 1.5% salt[1] to avoid alcohol tax. The third is shin mirin (lit. new mirin),[4] or mirin-fu chomiryo (lit. mirin-like seasoning),[5] which contains less than 1% alcohol yet retains the same flavour.

        In the Edo period, Mirin was drunk as a sweet sake.[6] Otoso, traditionally drunk on Shōgatsu, can be made by soaking a spice mixture in mirin.[7]
